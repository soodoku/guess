\title{Creates a transition matrix for each item.}
\usage{
multi_transmat(pre_test = NULL, pst_test = NULL, subgroup = NULL,
  force9 = FALSE, agg = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pre_test}{Required. data.frame carrying responses to pre-test questions.}

\item{pst_test}{Required. data.frame carrying responses to post-test questions.}

\item{subgroup}{a Boolean vector identifying the subset. Default is NULL.}

\item{force9}{Optional. There are cases where DK data doesn't have DK. But we need the entire matrix. By default it is FALSE.}

\item{agg}{Optional. Boolean. Whether or not to add a row of aggregate transitions at the end of the matrix. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
matrix with rows = total number of items + 1 (last row contains aggregate distribution across items)
number of columns = 4 when no don't know, and 9 when there is a don't know option
}
\description{
Needs an 'interleaved' dataframe (see interleave function). Pre-test item should be followed by corresponding post-item item etc. 
Don't knows must be coded as NA. Function handles items without don't know responses.
The function is used internally. It calls transmat.

\examples{
pre_test <- data.frame(pre_item1=c(1,0,0,1,0), pre_item2=c(1,NA,0,1,0)) 
pst_test <- data.frame(pst_item1=pre_test[,1] + c(0,1,1,0,0), 
					  pst_item2 = pre_test[,2] + c(0,1,0,0,1))
multi_transmat(pre_test, pst_test)
