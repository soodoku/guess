\alias{multi_transmat}
\title{Creates a transition matrix for each item.}
\usage{
multi_transmat(pre_test = NULL, pst_test = NULL, subgroup = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{pre_test}{Required. data.frame carrying responses to pre-test questions.}

\item{pst_test}{Required. data.frame carrying responses to post-test questions.}

\item{subgroup}{a Boolean vector identifying the subset. Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
matrix with rows = total number of items + 1 (last row contains aggregate distribution across items)
number of columns = 4 when no don't know, and 9 when there is a don't know option
}
\description{
Needs an 'interleaved' dataframe (see interleave function). Pre-test item should be followed by corresponding post-item item etc.
Don't knows must be coded as NA. Function handles items without don't know responses.
The function is used internally. It calls transmat.
}
\details{
multi_transmat: transition matrix of all the items
}
\examples{
pre_test <- data.frame(pre_item1=c(1,0,0,1,0), pre_item2=c(1,NA,0,1,0))
pst_test <- data.frame(pst_item1=pre_test[,1] + c(0,1,1,0,0),
						  pst_item2 = pre_test[,2] + c(0,1,0,0,1))
multi_transmat(pre_test, pst_test)
